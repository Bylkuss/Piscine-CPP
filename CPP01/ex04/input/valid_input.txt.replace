In the quiet stillness of soft the night, stars twinkle above, casting their gentle glow upon the Earth.
A soft breeze whispers through the trees, carrying with it the scent of blooming flowers.
Time seems suspended, as if nature itself is holding its breath, creating a moment of tranquil enchantment.
